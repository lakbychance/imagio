# Imagio
A NextJS powered Image Gallery demo-app made using Unsplash API. 

### Installing
`npm install` to install the node_modules.

### Running
Add Unsplash API's respective **client id** and **API URL** token in the `.env` files and then run `npm run dev`.

## Important
Current rate-limit for API is **50req/hour** and due to that if you try to access a photo url which isn't cached, a fallback error page generated by NextJS will be shown to the end user.
